# Case Study: Human Resource

## Problem Statement
A large company named XYZ, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons -
1. The former employees’ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners.
2. A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent.
3. More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatise themselves to the company.
Hence, the management has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.


Goal of the case study You are required to model the probability of attrition using a logistic regression. The results thus obtained will be used by the management to understand what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.

## Problem Description: What we need to find and solve
•	which employees in a company are more willing to leave or tend to basically leave the corporation.
•	Why do employees want to leave? 
•	Why do they want to stay? 
•	How can we make them motivated?  
•	What is the cost associated with basically employees leaving the company?

## Methods Used
•	Data Analysis 
•	Data Visualization
•	Statistical Analysis
•	Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest and ANN)
•	Predictive Modeling

## Result and Evaluation

In the context of predicting attrition rates, it has been observed that among three machine learning models employed, Logistic Regression demonstrated the highest level of accuracy, achieving a notable 87% accuracy rate. This finding underscores the efficacy of Logistic Regression in accurately predicting attrition rates, highlighting its potential as a robust tool for such predictive analytics tasks.
